# Plex MCP Server

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@djbriane/plex-mcp)](https://smithery.ai/server/@djbriane/plex-mcp)

This is a Python-based MCP server that integrates with the Plex Media Server API to search for movies and manage playlists. It uses the PlexAPI library for seamless interaction with your Plex server.

## Screenshots

Here are some examples of how the Plex MCP server works:

### 1. Find Movies in Plex Library by Director
Search for movies in your Plex library by specifying a director's name. For example, searching for "Alfred Hitchcock" returns a list of his movies in your library.

---

### 2. Find Missing Movies for a Director
Identify movies by a specific director that are missing from your Plex library. This helps you discover gaps in your collection.

### 3. Create a Playlist in Your Plex Library
Create a new playlist in your Plex library using the movies found in a search. This allows you to organize your library efficiently.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `uv` package manager
- A Plex Media Server with API access

### Installation

### Installing via Smithery

To install Plex Media Server Integration for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@djbriane/plex-mcp):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @djbriane/plex-mcp --client claude
```

### Installing Manually
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd plex-mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies with `uv`:
   ```
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   uv sync
   ```

3. Configure environment variables for your Plex server:
   - `PLEX_TOKEN`: Your Plex authentication token
   - `PLEX_SERVER_URL`: Your Plex server URL (e.g., http://192.168.1.100:32400)

### Finding Your Plex Token

You can find your Plex token in this way:

   - Sign in to Plex Web App
   - Open Developer Tools
   - In Console tab, paste and run:
     ```javascript
     window.localStorage.getItem('myPlexAccessToken')
     ```

## Usage with Claude

Add the following configuration to your Claude app:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "plex": {
            "command": "uv",
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "FULL_PATH_TO_PROJECT",
                "run",
                "plex_mcp/plex_mcp.py"
            ],
            "env": {
                "PLEX_TOKEN": "YOUR_PLEX_TOKEN",
                "PLEX_SERVER_URL": "YOUR_PLEX_SERVER_URL"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Running Tests

This project includes both unit tests and integration tests. Use the following instructions to run each type of test:

### Unit Tests

Unit tests use dummy data to verify the functionality of each module without requiring a live Plex server.

To run all unit tests:
```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests run against a live Plex server using environment variables defined in a .env file. First, create a .env file in your project root with your Plex configuration:

```env
PLEX_SERVER_URL=https://your-plex-server-url:32400
PLEX_TOKEN=yourPlexTokenHere
```

Integration tests are marked with the integration marker. To run only the integration tests:

```bash
uv run pytest -m integration
```

If you are experiencing connection issues to your Plex server try running the integration tests to help troubleshoot.

## Code Style and Conventions

- **Module Structure:**  
  Use clear section headers for imports, logging setup, utility functions, class definitions, global helpers, tool methods, and main execution (guarded by `if __name__ == "__main__":`).

- **Naming:**  
  Use CamelCase for classes and lower_snake_case for functions, variables, and fixtures. In tests, list built-in fixtures (e.g. `monkeypatch`) before custom ones.

- **Documentation & Comments:**  
  Include a concise docstring for every module, class, and function, with in-line comments for complex logic.

- **Error Handling & Logging:**  
  Use Python’s `logging` module with consistent error messages (prefix “ERROR:”) and explicit exception handling.

- **Asynchronous Patterns:**  
  Define I/O-bound functions as async and use `asyncio.to_thread()` to handle blocking operations.
